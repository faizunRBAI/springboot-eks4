# PostgreSQL is the deliberate exception: pgjdbc emulates libpq and reads a

# aurora-postgresql JDBC URLs in infra/ carry
# sslrootcert=/app/certs/rds-global-bundle.pem pointing at the bundle kept
# below. A first real deploy proved the difference: every pg connection died
# with "Could not open SSL root certificate file" until the URL said where the
